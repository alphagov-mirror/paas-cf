### Deploying as a Cloud Foundry app

From this directory, push the app to Cloud Foundry...

```bash
cf push paas-metrics --no-start
```

You'll need some environment variables set (you could also add these to the manifest)...

```bash
cf set-env paas-metrics ELB_ADDRESS "https://healthcheck/"  # Address of an ELB to check
cf set-env paas-metrics CF_API_ADDRESS "ENDPOINT"           # Cloud Foundry API endpoint URL
cf set-env paas-metrics CF_CLIENT_ID "UAA_CLIENT_ID"        # UAA client with cloud_foundry.global_auditor scope
cf set-env paas-metrics CF_CLIENT_SECRET "SECRET"           # UAA client secret
cf set-env paas-metrics AWS_REGION "eu-west-1"              # AWS region your CloudFront distributions are in
cf set-env paas-metrics AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "access_key"      # Key for a user capable of listing CloudFront distributions
cf set-env paas-metrics AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "secret"      # Secret key for the user above
cf set-env paas-metrics LOG_LEVEL "0"                       # [OPTIONAL] set to 0 for more detailed logs
cf set-env paas-metrics DEPLOY_ENV "prod"                   # [OPTIONAL] set to tag metrics with env
cf set-env paas-metrics TLS_DOMAINS "ssl1.com,ssl2.com"     # [OPTIONAL] csv list of domains to monitor TLS certs for
```

Start the app...

```bash
cf start paas-metrics
```


### Implementing new metrics

There is a `MetricReader` / `MetricWriter` interface similar to `io.Reader` / `io.Writer`.

"gauges" are implemented as `MetricReaders` that are merged into a single stream of `Metrics` (see [main.go](main.go)).

"reporters" are implemented as `MetricWriters` (see [prometheus_reporter.go](prometheus_reporter.go)).

An example gauge that polls pointlessly for random numbers using the `NewMetricPoller` helper might look like:

```go
var RandomMetric := NewMetricPoller(10 * time.Second, func(w MetricWriter) error {
	return w.WriteMetrics([]Metric{
		{
			Kind: Gauge,
			Name: "my.random.thing",
			Time: time.Now(),
			Value: rand.Float64(100.0),
		},
	})
})

```

You could then consume it by copying the metrics to a writer using CopyMetrics:

```go
_ = CopyMetrics(reporter, RandomMetric)
```

### Debugging

If you run the app with `DEBUG=1` it will write all metrics to the stdout.

### Running tests

You can execute tests with the standard go test command from this dir:

```
make test
```

### Regenerating mocks

```
make generate-fakes
```

### Updating dependencies

dep is used for dependencies. to update the vendor dir do:

```
dep ensure
```
